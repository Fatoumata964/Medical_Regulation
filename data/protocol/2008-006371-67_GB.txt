D.8 Information on Placebo
D.8 Placebo: 1
D.8.1 Is a Placebo used in this Trial? Yes

E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: To determine whether anti-platelet agent clopidigrel influences the disposition of NNRTIs (efavirenz and nevirapine)
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: We wish to determine whether the cardiac drug clopidogrel inhibit the metabolism of the HIV drugs Efavirenz and Nevirapine and therefore increase the concentration of these drugs (efavirenz and nevirapine) in the body. The implication of this is both to minimise the risk of toxicity,  but also the potential to exploit these interactions with the view to influence new formulations of these agents (efavirenz and nevirapine) which would potentially be less toxic.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: We wish to determine the safety of taking both efavirenz, nevirapine and cardiac drug clopidogrel in HIV patients, a scenario that is likely to become common with increasing survival of HIV patients. 
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
