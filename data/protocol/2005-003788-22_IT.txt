E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary efficacy analysis will compare the treatment groups with respect to the change from baseline in BDI total score after 12 weeks of treatment.  The analysis will be performed using analysis of covariance with centre and treatment fitted as main effects and the baseline BDI total score as a covariate.  The adjusted treatment group difference and corresponding 95  confidence interval will be presented along with the p-value.
