Similarly, during the baseline run-in period, any patient with more than one severe hypoglycemic episode, or any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor diabetic control (other than for hypoglycemia), will be excluded from randomization. Severe hypoglycemia is defined in Section 10.11.2. of the protocol.6.	Metabolic Conditions:a)	Significant hypoglycemia risk e.g., history of >2 severe (DCCT) hypoglycemic episodes within past 6 months, known adrenal insufficiency, symptomatic autonomic neuropathy b)	Current chronic inhaled or systemic corticosteroid treatment likely to be of metabolic effect (prednisone equivalent >2 mg/day); intercurrent treatment at a higher dose is allowed if treatment duration does not exceed 2 weeks7.

A screening chest x-ray or chest MRI is defined as a chest x-ray or chest MRI obtained at screening or 6 months prior to screening. Subjects with radiographically stable and clinically insignificant abnormalities need not be excluded (e.g., localized scarring or calcified granulomata).  Documentation of stability requires comparison with previous radiographs obtained at least 6 months earlier.   c)	Significant pulmonary diseases including:·History of moderate or severe asthma including those with daily symptoms and/or require daily use of inhaled short acting beta2-agonist.·History of moderate or severe COPD including those requiring regular use of one or more bronchodilators (beta2-agonists, anticholinergics, methylxanthines). However, short acting bronchodilators used as needed (prn) are allowed. ·Poorly-controlled asthma, clinically significant obstructive pulmonary disease or other significant respiratory disease.  9.Cardiovascular conditions:a)Significant cardiovascular dysfunction and/or history including hospitalization within the preceding six months, e.g., congestive heart failure or serious arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, cardiac surgery, recurrent syncope, transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accident.b)	Poorly-controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure >110 mmHg) on two readings (sitting).c)Abnormal screening ECG: i)predominant rhythm other than normal sinusii)A-V block greater than first degree iii)resting heart rate > 100 or < 50 bpm  The principal investigator, or other designated physician at each site, will be responsible for deciding the clinical significance of any abnormal ECG findings.10.

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that mean the reduction in HbA1c after 52 weeks (approx. 12 months) of treatment is greater in patients to whom inhaled insulin is made available compared to patients to whom it is not. Thus, the primary efficacy variable is the difference in HbA1c between baseline (Week -2) and the end of the treatment period at week 52, in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population
