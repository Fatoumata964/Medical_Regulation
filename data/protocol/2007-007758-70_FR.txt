D.8 Information on Placebo

E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in pediatric patients (CKD) on hemodialysis 
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 9.1
E.1.2 Level: LLT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10058124
E.1.2 Term: Nephrogenic anemia
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: - To determine the starting dose of MIRCERA® in pediatric patients with CKD on hemodialysis when switching from stable maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa, epoetin beta or darbepoetin alfa
- To demonstrate changes in Hb over time in response to different iv doses of MIRCERA®
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: - To study the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MIRCERA® in pediatric patients
- To explore MIRCERA® exposure response relationship
- To assess the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of MIRCERA® in pediatric patients
- To document long-term safety and efficacy of MIRCERA® administration in pediatric patients with anemia associated with CKD
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1. Written informed consent
2. Pediatric patients 5 -17 years old with clinically stable chronic renal anemia
3. Hemodialysis treatment for at least 8 weeks
4. Body weight ≥ 10 kg
5. Adequate hemodialysis: URR of > 65% or Kt/V >1.2 for patients on thrice weekly HD. Patients with fewer or with more HD sessions per week should have a weekly Kt/V ≥ 3.6
6. Baseline pre-dialysis Hb concentration 10.0 – 12.0 g/dL determined from the mean of weekly Hb values measured between weeks -2 to -1
7. Intravenous maintenance epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, or darbepoetin alfa with same dosing interval for at least 8 weeks before screening
8. Stable maintenance epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, or darbepoetin alfa treatment with no weekly dose change ≥ 25% (increase or decrease) during the 2-weeks of screening. Patients who had been previously treated by the sc route could only
participate if they have been receiving their ESA by the iv route for at least 8 weeks before screening.
9. Adequate iron status defined as serum ferritin ≥ 100 ng/mL or TSAT ≥ 20% (or percentage of hypochromic red cells <10%); mean of two values measured during screening
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1. Overt gastrointestinal bleeding within 8 weeks before screening or during the screening period
2. RBC transfusions within 8 weeks before screening or during the screening period
3. Hemoglobinopathies (e.g., homozygous sickle-cell disease, thalassemia of all types)
4. Hemolysis
5. Active malignant disease
6. Chronic, uncontrolled or symptomatic inflammatory disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus)
7. Poorly controlled hypertension (e.g. BP >95th percentile for age and sex on two consecutive hemodialysis sessions) despite adequate ultrafiltration
8. Epileptic seizures within 3 months prior to screening and during the screening period
9. Administration of any investigational drug within 4 weeks prior to screening and planned during the study
10. Severe hyperparathyroidism (Intact PTH ≥ 1000 pg/ml or whole PTH ≥ 500 pg/ml) or biopsy-proven bone marrow fibrosis
11. Known hypersensitivity to recombinant human erythropoietin, polyethylene glycol, or to any constituent of the study drug formulation
12. Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) or history of PRCA
13. High likelihood of early withdrawal or interruption of the study (e.g. planned living donor kidney transplant within 16 weeks after randomization)
14. Planned elective surgery during the entire study period (except hemodialysis access surgery)
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary endpoint in this study will be the change in Hb concentration (g/dL) between the baseline and evaluation periods. The different MIRCERA® dose groups will be compared in an exploratory manner, using summary statistics based on means, standard deviations and percentiles. The analysis will be performed for all patients of the dose group combined as well as stratified by age category (≥5 to <12 years versus ≥12 years).
