E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female subject, aged >= 18 years.
2. Subject has given voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study related procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.
3. Subject was previously diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on standard criteria and has measurable disease. Measurable disease for secretory multiple myeloma is defined as any quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not exclusively, greater than 1 g/dL of immunoglobulin G (IgG) M-Protein and greater than 0.5g/dL immunoglobulin A (IgA)) or urine light-chain excretion of >= 200 mg/24 hours.
4. Subject previously tolerated 1.0 or 1.3 mg/m2/dose of VELCADE alone or in combination with other agents and had CR or PR upon completion of VELCADE therapy.
5. It has been >= 6 months since the subject's last VELCADE dose and the subject has Progressive Disease (PD) if prior response to VELCADE was PR or subject has relapsed from CR. PD or relapse are defined as one or more of the following criteria:
Criteria for PD for subjects that had PR to previous VELCADE course:
· >25% increase in either serum or urine M-protein;
· >25% increase in plasma cells on bone marrow;
· Definite increase in size of bone lesion or plasmacytoma;
· Development of new bone lesion or plasmacytoma; or
· Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5 mg/dl or 2.8 mmol/l) not attributable to other causes.
Criteria for relapse from CR:
· Reappearance of serum or urinary paraprotein on immunofixation or routine electrophoresis, confirmed by at least one further investigation and excluding oligoclonal immune reconstitution
· >5% plasma cells in bone marrow aspirate or on trephine bone biopsy
· Development of new lytic bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of residual bone lesions
· Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11,5 mg/dl or 2.8 mmol/l) not attributable to any other cause.
6. Subject has a Karnofsky performance status >=60% (see Attachment 1: Karnofsky Performance Status Scale).
7. Subject has a life-expectancy >3 months.

· Hemoglobin >=7.5 g/dL without transfusion support within 7 days before the test;
· Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >=0.75 x 10 exp.9/L without the use of growth factors; 
· Corrected serum calcium <14 mg/dL (3.5 mmol/L);
· Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) <=2.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN);
· Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) <=2.5 x the ULN;
· Total bilirubin <=1.5 x the ULN; and
· Calculated or measured creatinine clearance >=20 mL/minute (see Attachment 2: Creatinine Clearance Calculation for formula to calculate clearance from serum creatinine).
9. If female, the subject is either postmenopausal or surgically sterilised or willing to use an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., total abstinence - periodic abstinence can not be allowed -, a hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, diaphragm with spermicide, or condom with spermicide) from screening through at least 30 days after completion of the last treatment cycle.
10. If male, the subject agrees to use an acceptable barrier method for contraception from screening through at least 30 days after completion of the last treatment cycle.
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1. Subjects with a history of PD, minimal response, or stable disease (SD) on last exposure to VELCADE.
2. Subject has received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, antibody, immunotherapy, or experimental therapy to treat multiple myeloma since their last dose of VELCADE. Note: Subjects can have received localized palliative radiotherapy for complications due to osteolytic bone lesions. Subjects can have received steroids (cumulative exposure of up to 160 mg of Dexamethasone or equivalent) or thalidomide or Interferon as maintenance therapy since their last dose of VELCADE. Subjects can have received high dose therapy/stem cell transplantation after VELCADE containing induction regimen, only if PR or CR was observed during VELCADE containing induction therapy.
