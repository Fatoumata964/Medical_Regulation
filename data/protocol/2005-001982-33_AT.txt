E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients with partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation.
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 8.0
E.1.2 Level: PT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10061334
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To determine the efficacy and safety of adjunctive open label zonisamide treatment in patients with refractory partial seizures
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: None stated.
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: Information not present in EudraCT
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1) Male or female adult patients aged 18-75 
2) Able and willing to give written informed consent in accordance with the ICH GCP Guidelines. 
3) Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant (as confirmed by negative serum Î²HCG at screening and negative urine pregnancy test at baseline ), must not be lactating and must use a medically acceptable form of contraception during the study and for at least 1 month after discontinuation of study drug. Medically acceptable contraception as defined here is the oral contraceptive pill, surgical sterilization or adequate barrier methods (i.e. a condom and spermicide, intrauterine device in place for at least 3 months or diaphragm and foam). Women who are less than 2 years post menopausal are considered to be of childbearing potential. 
4) Focal epilepsy, with simple and/or complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalized seizures as defined by the ILAE criteria. 
5) Patients with a minimum of 4 partial seizures in the 8 weeks preceding the baseline visit as adequately recorded using a seizure diary card. 
6) Patients should be receiving at least 1 but no more than 2 other AEDs as concomitant medication, and the dosage should be stable for at least 8 weeks before the baseline visit.

E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1) History of status epilepticus within the last 5 years
2) Patients with known significantly impaired renal function and/or severe hepatic impairment to the extent that the protocol dose titration schedule cannot be followed. Note investigators should consult included SmPC as a guide. 
3) Patients suffering from clinically significant psychiatric illness, psychological or behavioral problems which could interfere with study participation.
4) Patients with a history (within the last 12 months) of alcohol or drug abuse or dependency.
5) Patient suffering from any CNS progressive disease that may confound study interpretation, any active CNS infection, demyelinating disease or degenerative neurological disease.
6) Patients with a significant drug sensitivity or significant allergic reaction to any drug including sulphonamides.
7)Subjects considered by the investigator to be an unsuitable candidate for receiving zonisamide or considered unlikely to comply with the protocol.
8) Any patient contraindicated for ZonegranTM treatment as per attached SmPC


E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to end of week 19 in partial seizure frequency. This will allow for a direct comparison of seizure frequency in the fixed dose period (beginning of week 16 to end of week 19) with the baseline seizure frequency, calculated as the average number of seizures/4 week period during 8 consecutive weeks prior to the baseline visit.
