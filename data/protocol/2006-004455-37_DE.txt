F.3.1 Healthy volunteers: No
F.3.2 Patients: Yes
F.3.3 Specific vulnerable populations: Yes
F.3.3.1 Women of childbearing potential not using contraception  
(For clinical trials recorded in the database before the 10th March 2011 this question read: "Women of childbearing potential" and
did not include the words "not using contraception". An answer of yes could have included women of child bearing potential whether
or not they would be using contraception. The answer should therefore be understood in that context. This trial was recorded in the
database on 2007-04-23) : Yes
F.3.3.2 Women of child-bearing potential using contraception: Yes
F.3.3.3 Pregnant women: No
F.3.3.4 Nursing women: No
F.3.3.5 Emergency situation: No
F.3.3.6 Subjects incapable of giving consent personally: No
F.3.3.7 Others: No
F.4 Planned number of subjects to be included
F.4.1 In the member state: 260
F.4.2 For a multinational trial
F.4.2.2 In the whole clinical trial: 260
F.5 Plans for treatment or care after the subject has ended the participation in the trial (if it is different from the expected normal treatment of that condition): Type 2 diabetes is a disease which requires a tight control of blood glucose levels and continious treatment. When a patient has ended the participation in the trial, therapy will be continued in the responsibility of the treating physician. In this trial, approved drugs are tested for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, so of course the physician can decide to continue the treatment of the study subjects after the final visit.
