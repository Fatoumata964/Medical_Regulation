E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of two switching strategies from risperidone to
aripiprazole over a period of 12 weeks in out-patients who are treated in a general psychiatric practice
setting and who are currently experiencing efficacy and/or safety/tolerability issues while on risperidone.
The proportion of patients who discontinued because of AE’s will be compared between the 2 switching
strategies.

E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To investigate whether out of two switching strategies one is best in term of:
• Patient's and caregiver's preference of medicine (POM)
• Subjective well-being under neuroleptics (SWN)
• Extra-pyramidal signs and symptoms Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS).
To examine the impact of switching from risperidone to aripiprazole in terms of
effectiveness, efficacy, effect on cognitive functioning and on Outcomes Research
measures and to further evaluate safety and tolerability of aripiprazole using:
• Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I)
• Investigator’s Assessment Questionnaire (IAQ)
• Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
