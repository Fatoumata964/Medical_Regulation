E.1.2 Level: LLT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10030043
E.1.2 Term: Ocular hypertension
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To compare the IOP-lowering efficacy of morning or evening instillations of Travoprost/Brinzolamide, versus Travatan dosed in the evening, versus Azopt dosed in the morning and in the evening, in patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: None
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: Patients, of either sex and any race, 18 years of age or older, diagnosed with openangle  glaucoma (with or without pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion  component) or ocular hypertension. Patients inadequately controlled on a current stable (i.e., at least 4 weeks)  IOP-lowering medication. Inadequately controlled is defined as having a mean IOP  &#8805; 18 mmHg in at least one eye during the Screening Visit. Patients must meet the following IOP entry criteria in at least one eye. For each  qualifying eye, the mean IOP must be:  &#8805; 24 mmHg and &#8804; 36 mmHg at the 9:00 time point at both Eligibility Visits 1 and 2;  &#8805; 21 mmHg and &#8804; 36 mmHg at the 11:00 and 16:00 time points at both Eligibility  Visits 1 and 2.  The mean IOP in either eye at the Eligibility Visits 1 and 2 must not be greater than  36 mmHg at any time point.  The same eye(s) must qualify at all qualifying time points at both Eligibility Visits 1  and 2.  The mean IOP is the average of at least two IOP measurements in the same eye.  Only patients who satisfy all Informed Consent requirements may be included in the  study. Patients who wear contact lenses will be allowed to participate in the study provided  that the contact lenses are removed before instillation of study medication, and that  the patients wait a minimum of 15 minutes following drug instillation before  re-inserting the lenses. Patients using non prescription and/or prescription topical ophthalmic and/or  systemic medications not affecting IOP (except for those in the Exclusion Criteria)  may be included in the study. Patients must be able to discontinue use of all IOP-lowering medication(s) for a  minimum period of 5 days to 28 days prior to Eligibility Visit 1. The Investigator  shall assess the minimum washout period based on the class of the patients current  IOP-lowering medication. Patients willing to complete all required study visits.
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: Pregnancy:  Females of childbearing potential (those who are not surgically sterilized or at least  two years post-menopausal) are excluded from participation in the study if they meet  any one of the following conditions:  - They are currently pregnant or,  - They have a positive result on the urine pregnancy test at the Screening Visit or,  - They intend to become pregnant during the study period or,  - They are breast-feeding or,  - They are not using highly effective birth control measures:  Hormonal - oral, implanted, topical, or injected contraceptives;  Mechanical - spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as a condom or  diaphragm or IUD.  Exclusion Criteria related to the condition being investigated:  Patients with any form of glaucoma other than open-angle glaucoma (with or without  a pigment dispersion or pseudoexfoliation component) or ocular hypertension.Patients with iridocorneal angle Shaffer grade < 2 (extreme narrow angle with  complete or partial closure) angle in either eye, as measured by gonioscopy (see  Section 18.1.4.). Patients with a cup/disc ratio greater than 0.80 (horizontal or vertical measurement)  in either eye.  Patients with severe central visual field loss in either eye. Severe central field loss is  defined as a sensitivity of &#8804; 10 dB in at least 2 of the 4 visual field test points closest  to the point of fixation. Current chronic, recurrent or severe inflammatory eye disease (e.g., scleritis, uveitis,  herpes keratitis). History of ocular trauma within the past 6 months. Intraocular surgery within the past 6 months.Ocular laser surgery within the past 3 months. Best-corrected visual acuity score worse than 55 ETDRS letters read (equivalent to  approximately 20/80 Snellen or 0.25 decimal).Current ocular infection or inflammation, or history of ocular infection or inflammation within the past 3 months, as determined by patients history and/or  examination.  History of or current clinically relevant or progressive retinal disease, such as retinal  degeneration, diabetic retinopathy or retinal detachment. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry. History of, or current evidence of severe illness or any other conditions which would  make the patient, in the opinion of the Investigator, unsuitable for the study. History of severe or serious hypersensitivity to prostaglandin drugs or their  analogues, CAIs or to any components of the study medications. For listings of  additional formulation components present in the study medications, see the Clinical  Investigators Brochure for Travoprost / Brinzolamide which includes the Summary  of Product Characteristics for TRAVATAN and AZOPT. Less than 30 days on stable dosing regimen before the Screening Visit with any  medications or substances administered by any route and used on a chronic basis that  may affect IOP, including, but not limited to, beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Use of any additional topical or systemic ocular hypotensive medication during the  study. Patients who cannot safely discontinue glucocorticoid medications administered by  any route. Patients must have washed out of chronic glucocorticoid medications for  at least 4 weeks, or of intermittent glucocorticoid medications for at least 2 weeks  before Eligibility 1 Visit, and must be able to remain off these medications for the  duration of the study. Recent (within 4 weeks of Eligibility 1 Visit) use of high dose (> 1 gram daily)  salicylate therapy. Rare instances of drug interactions have occurred with high-dose  salicylate therapy and patients treated with oral CAIs. Patients who are currently on therapy or were on therapy with another investigational  agent within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit.
