E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Patients with known history of type 2 Diabetes Mellitus longer than 6 months, who were treated by diet in combination with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) are to be included in the study.
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The overall goal of the present trial is to study the influence of insulin Levemir treatment on the endothelial function of patients with type 2 DM by noninvasive measurement of flow-mediated ndothelium-dependent dilation (EDD) of the brachial artery.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: In addition, following plasma parameters will be investigated: lipid profile, plasma glucose, HbA1c, plasma insulin level, renal and hepatic parameters and C-reactive protein (CRP).

E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: All patients are recruited from the diabetes outpatient department of the department of Internal Medicine, Medical University Innsbruck. Patients’ inclusion criteria are the gender (female), the subject’s age (35 to 55 years), history of type 2 DM over 6 months and level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >7% despite pre-existing treatment with diet and OADs. 
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: To reduce the confounding effects of other cardiovascular risk factors often associated with type 2 DM, patients with inadequately controlled hypertension (blood pressure >135/85 mmHg), with hyperlipidemias other than the high triglyceride-low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol diabetic dislipidemia, and with a history of cardiovascular disease and smoking are excluded from the study. Medical treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia remains unchanged 6 weeks before recruitment and is continued during the study protocol.  Acute infectious and inflammatory diseases, as well as hepatic, renal and cardiac failure are excluded by taking a careful history and performing physical and laboratory examinations. Also, breastfeeding and pregnant women are excluded from the study protocol. 
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): After baseline measurement of EDD and routinely examined plasma parameters (see E.2.2), patients are randomly assigned to three groups: group 1 receiving NPH-insulin, group 2 receiving insulin Levemir and group 3 with diet and OADs. 
After a treatment period of 3 months, sonography scans as well as laboratory measurements are repeated during a routine examination at the diabetes outpatient department. All decisions on individual insulin treatment are left to the treating physician of the diabetes outpatient department, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University Innsbruck, following established internal therapeutic regimens.
