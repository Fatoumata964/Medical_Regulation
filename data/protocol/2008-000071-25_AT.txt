E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The primary objective is to explore clinical safety with self-treatment of acute HAE
attacks with subcutaneous injections of icatibant.

E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:
• Males and females ≥18 years of age at the time of informed consent
• Documented diagnosis of HAE Type I or II based on ALL of the following
criteria:
• Family and/or medical history
• Characteristic attack manifestations, recurrent attacks
• Historical functional C1-INH <50% normal values
• Women of childbearing potential must use consistently and correctly a highly
effective, adequate method of birth control (failure rate less than 1% per year) -
sexual abstinence or have a vasectomised partner during the duration of the
study. Hormonal contraception can be continued if verified by a physician that it
doesn’t affect the course of HAE attacks.
• Mental and physical condition allowing patients to complete baseline
assessment, to self-administer icatibant and to follow other study procedures.
• Ability to provide signed written informed consent after all aspects of the study
have been explained and discussed with the patient.

• Participation in a clinical trial of another investigational medicinal product
within the past month (except a previous icatibant study).
• Diagnosis of angioedema other than Type I or Type II HAE.
• Evidence of symptomatic coronary artery disease based on medical history, in
particular, unstable angina pectoris or severe coronary heart disease.
• Congestive heart failure (NYHA Class 3 and 4).
• Stroke within the past 6 months.
• Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.
• Pregnancy and/or breast-feeding.
• In the opinion of the investigator: mental condition rendering the patient unable
to understand the nature, scope and possible consequences of the study.
• In the opinion of the investigator: unlikely to comply with the protocol, for
example, uncooperative attitude, inability to return for follow-up visits, or
unlikely to complete the study for any reason.
• In the opinion of the investigator: inability to manage study medication or selfadministration of an injection.
