MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The objective is to demonstrate safety. 
Adverse events will be recorded as a similar way as in patient treated only with standard of care.


E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: Efficacy of combined photodynamic therapy with Visudyne and anti-VEGF intravitreal injections with Lucentis for subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation in age related macular degeneration in cases with indication for Visudyne treatment as a standard of care. 
All patients accepting participation in the trial will receive Visudyne treatment and a first intravitreal injection the same day, and will receive a second intravitreal injection after 1 month and a third 1 month later. Thereafter further treatment will be discussed with the patient and depents on the evoluation of the disease as defined by usual care in the Medical Retina section of the Department Ophthamology of the U.Z. Leuven. 

E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary objective is to demonstrate the safety of the combined therapy of photodynamic therapy with Visudyne and intravitreal injection of ranibizumab.
Secondary endpoint is  efficacy determined:
1) by the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) from baseline to month 12;
2) changes of visual field determined with microperimetry (MP1) and
3) morphologic changes determined with Optical Coherence Tomography, fundus photography and fluoresceine angiography.
