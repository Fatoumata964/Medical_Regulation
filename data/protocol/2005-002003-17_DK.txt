E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Mantle cell lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma which is rare and holds a bad prognosis with no known curative therapies available. The lymphoma is most often disseminated at diagnosis. 
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The main objective of the third Nordic phase II trial in mantle cell lymhoma is to improve the failure-free survivial in pasients who are not in complete remission before transplant by including Zevalin radioimmuntherapy as part of the high-dose regimen before autologous stem cell support.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: Evaluate safety by including Zevalin in the high-dose regimen
Evaluate FFS in patients who are in CR before transplant and thus not receiving Zevalin
Evaluate OS in all both patient groups
Evaluate TTF in both patient groups
Evaluate TTP in both patient groups
Evaluate response rates
Evaluate molecular response rates
Evaluate molecular response and progression-free survival in patients who become PCR positive in bone marrow post-transplant and receive treatment with Rituximab
Evaluate lymphoma tissue gene expression profiles and correlate this to outcome
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: Information not present in EudraCT
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: Histologically and immunhistologically defined diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma
Previously untreated, except one course of any regimen
18-65 years of age
WHO performance status 0-3
Written informed consent
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: Previously treated for lymphoma
Severe medical conditions or infections
Pregnancy
Other malignancies in the past
Severe psyciatric disorders
Unwilling or anable to comply with the protocol
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): Time to treatment failure for pasients receiving not in complete remission prior to transplant and thus receiving Zevalin in addition to the high-dose chemotherapy regimen. A comparisom is to be made to patients included in the previous phase II study, where patients received identical treatment, but without Zevalin. 150 patients have been included in the previoous trial.
