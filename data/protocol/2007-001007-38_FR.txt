E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Paediatric patient who present a cystic fibrosis
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The primary objective is to assess the biological efficacy of Vedrop in 30 paediatric patients with cystic fibrosis over a mid term exposure period of time, with assessments after 3 and 6 months of treatment.  Patients will be monitored after 3 and 6 months of treatment, on their clinical status and on their tocopherolemia and lipidic status.  
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: The secondary aim of the present study is to monitor the safety of Vedrop in these cystic fibrosis patients treated over this 6-month period.
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: - Patients should be less than or equal to 15 years old, i.e. up to their 16th birthday;
- With written informed consent of both parents and, if considered receivable by the investigator, of the patient;

- Cystic fibrosis (CF) will be ascertained by:	
either by a sweat chloride value ≥ 60mEq/L (at least two tests are required);
	

or by a patient's genotype (if already available in the patient's medical file) with two identifiable mutations consistent with cystic fibrosis; 	

and confirmed by a comprehensive clinical assessment (detailed medical history and a complete physical examination) and laboratory investigations (haematological and blood chemistry tests, urinalysis), the results of which are within the normal range or clinically acceptable for this category of patients;
- Patients with an exocrine pancreatic insufficiency defined by at least one functional pancreatic test. Pancreatic insufficiency could be defined by the existence of an obvious steatorrhea quantified by:
- a fat loss equal to or more than 4 g/day and /or
- a fat absorption below 93% in 3 day faecal fat balance and /or
- a faecal elastase below 100 µg/g faeces.

E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: - Who have a medical history which, in the judgement of the investigator, puts them 'at risk' or is likely to modify their handling of the study drug;
- Who have a too poor clinical status to cope with a clinical investigation;
- History of allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to the study drug or one of its constituents; 
- Absence of written informed consent by either parents or child;
- Renal failure;
- Patients who might be during the protocol duration or are already on a waiting list for lung or liver transplant;
- Who present a meconial ileus with intestinal resection.

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The end points are the biological efficacy and safety variables:
-The patient clinical and biological status;
-The patient tocopherolemia and lipidic status;
-The patient incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs);
-The patient incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs).
