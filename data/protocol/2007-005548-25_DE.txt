E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Patients with high-grade gliomas (world health organisation [WHO] grade III or IV) in the first relapse after first-line therapy including chemotherapy with or without nitrososurea, with a life expectancy of at least 6 months and undergoing active treatment with chemotherapy
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To determine the number of infective episodes in patients with high grade gliomas during treatment with 10% intravenous immunoglobulin (Kiovig) compared with placebo (normal saline).
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To determine the following during treatment with Kiovig compared with placebo:

•       number of patients with infective episodes 
•	number of days on antibiotics 
•       number of days with fever (body temperature (T) > 38.5°C) 
•       number of infective deaths 
•	number of hospitalisations 
•	number of days in hospital 
•	time to progression 
•	Compare serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, and IgM levels 
•	Assess the quality of life (QoL) 
•	Karnofsky performance scale assessment and mini mental state examination (MMSE) 
•	Assess the total costs (socioeconomic evaluation)
•	Evaluate reported adverse events (AEs), changes in vital signs, laboratory tests, and physical examination
•	Evaluate tumour progression
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1.	Male and female patients ≥ 18 years old
