E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To establish an optimal monitoring regimen for IGF-I in NutropinAq treated children, using a newly developed capillary blood spot IGF-I measurements technology.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: 1.To assess under clinical practice conditions, the biological variability of IGF-I (if any) in children treated with NutropinAq (physiological intra-individual variations, timing, dose of NutropinAq) and in different diseases conditions
2. Assuming a significant biological variability is observed, to identify parameters contributing to or related to this variability
3. To further validate the filter paper versus serum method IGF-I assay in the study setting
