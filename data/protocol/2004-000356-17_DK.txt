The precision profile of capillary vs plasma IGF-I measurements. 

The auxological parameters during NutropinAq treatment: changes in height, weight, growth velocity and height standard deviation score at each visit (M3 & M6).

The acceptability of the NutropinAq Pen by a questionnaire administered at M5.
