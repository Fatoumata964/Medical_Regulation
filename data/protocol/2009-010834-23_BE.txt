E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: - Patients of either sex and any race ,of 18 years of age or older.

- Patients must meet the following IOP entry criteria in at least one eye at Eligibility
Visits 1 & 2:
• Mean IOP ≥ 24 mmHg at the 09:00 time point, and
• Mean IOP ≥ 21 mmHg at the 11:00 and 16:00 time points.
• The mean IOP in either eye at Screening or Eligibility must not be greater than 36 mmHg at any time point.
The mean IOP is the average of IOP measurements in the same eye, as described in Section 9.4.7.

progressive retinal disease such as retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal detachment.

- History of or current severe, unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular, hepatic, or renal disease (e.g., sinus bradycardia, overt cardiac failure, greater than first degree
atrioventricular block, cardiogenic shock, clinically relevant angina or uncontrolled
hypertension) that would preclude the safe administration of a topical beta-adrenergic blocking agent.

study.
