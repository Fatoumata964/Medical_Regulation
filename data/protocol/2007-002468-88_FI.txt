E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Measles, mumps, rubella and varicella vaccine administered to healthy children from 9 months of age
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The first primary objective is to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad®  rHA administered at a 3-month interval to healthy childrenof  11 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is as immunogenic as in healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1, in terms of antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2.
The second primary objective, only if the first primary objective is reached, is similar to the first one at 9 months of age.
To demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad® rHA administered at a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age and 9 months of age at the time of Dose 1 is well tolerated compared to healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1.

E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To describe the antibody titres to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad® rHA administered to healthy children from 9 months of age. 

To evaluate the safety profile of Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad® rHA administered to healthy children from 9 months of age.

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary immunogenicity endpoints will be the antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella measured at Day 42 following Dose 2 (Blood sample 3).
