E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: The effectiveness of Ambirix will be investigated in 2 groups:
1) children with hiv-infection, with CD4 counts > 15%
2) children with a rheumatic disease for which immune-suppressive medication is used.
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 9.1
E.1.2 Level: LLT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10002725
E.1.2 Term: Anti-HIV positive
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 9.1
E.1.2 Level: LLT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10059176
E.1.2 Term: Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: How effective is combined vaccination against hepatitis A and B in hiv-infected children and in children using immune-suppressive medication for juvenile idiopathic arthritis?
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: Is the degree of immunesuppression related/ associated with the response to vaccination?
Markers for degree of immunesuppression are:
for hiv-infected children: CD4-cell count and viral load
for children using immune-suppressive medication for JIA: dosage and duration of use of the immunesuppressive medication.
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: All children from 1 up to and including 15 years of age, known with: 
- hiv-infection irrespective of treatment status. The most recent tested CD4 T cell percentage should be 15% or higher (group 1); OR:
- juvenile idiopathic arthritis, for which one or more of the following treatments is used (orally or systemically): Prednis(ol)on ≥ 0.25 mg/ kg body weight, or another corticosteroid in equivalent dosage; Etanercept (Enbrel®); Infliximab (Remicade®); Methotrexaat (Emthexate® or Metoject®) (group 2)
are eligible for inclusion.
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: Not eligible for inclusion are:
- children who have received one or more vaccinations against hepatitis A and/ or hepatitis B before;
- children who have been infected with hepatitis A and/ or hepatitis B (serologically proven);
- children who received immunoglobulins within 6 months prior to study entrance. 
- children known with a blood clotting disorder which prohibits intramuscular administration of the vaccine. 
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): Primary end points of this study are: 
- the percentages of children with hiv or use of immunesuppressive medication who seroconverted for hepatitis A (anti-hepatitis A virus IgG antibodies, anti-HAV-IgG) and hepatitis B (anti-hepatitis B surface antigen IgG antibodies, anti-HBs-IgG): 4-6 weeks after the first vaccination, prior to the second vaccination, and 4-6 weeks after the second vaccination. For hepatitis A, seroconversion is defined as: more than 30 IU/L anti-HAV-IgG. For hepatitis B, seroconversion is defined as: more than 10 IU/L anti-HBs IgG. 
- the geometric mean titre (GMT) per group, at aforementioned time points.  

These will be compared with seroconversionpercentages and GMT of non-immune-suppressed children (already known from previously performed studies).
