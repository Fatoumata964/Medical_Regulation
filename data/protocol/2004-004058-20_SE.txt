E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of anagrelide and its active metabolite in young (18-50 years) versus elderly (≥ 65 years) essential thrombocythaemia (ET) patients.

To evaluate the correlation, if any, between plasma concentration of anagrelide and its active metabolite and heart rate and blood pressure in young (18-50 years) and elderly (≥65 years) ET patients.

To assess the safety and tolerability of anagrelide in young (18-50 years) and elderly (≥65 years) ET patients.
