12. Life expectancy of more than three months and able to undergo routine outpatient evaluations for efficacy, safety, and/or compliance.
13. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) and males having intercourse with FCBP must agree to comply with using an effective contraceptive method for the duration of the treatment (FCBP is a sexually mature woman who is not surgically sterile or has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months).
14. All females must be non-nursing, non-pregnant and have a negative pregnancy test within two weeks of starting study drugs.

Class III or IV cardiac disease, hypotension or severe hypertension, vasomotor instability, serious or uncontrolled cardiac dysrhythmias (including ventricular arrhythmias) at any time, acute myocardial infarction within the past 12 months, active uncontrolled angina pectoris or symptomatic arteriosclerotic blood vessel disease.
4. Other active malignancies except in situ carcinoma of the cervix, localized squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
5. Serious concurrent or recent non-malignant medical conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, makes the patient unsuitable for participation in this study.
6. History of seizures, central nervous system disorders, stroke within the last 12 months, or psychiatric disability thought to be clinically significant in the opinion of the Investigator and adversely affecting compliance to protocol. 
7. Patients unable to undergo repeat treatments, clinical evaluations and other diagnostic procedures required by the protocol.
8. Active autoimmune disease (including but not limited to systemic lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis).
9. Patients with active peptic or esophageal ulcer disease or with past peptic ulcer or esophageal disease with a history or bleeding.

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): Primary Endpoints
The quantitative and qualitative pharmacodynamic effects of Ceplene/IL-2 on the immune responses of T and NK cells will be assessed as follows:

1. Changes in T and NK cell phenotypes (CD56, CD3, CD4, CD8) in peripheral blood from Day 1 (baseline) to Day 21  of Cycle 1 and from Day 1 (pre-treatment Cycle 3) to Day 21 of Cycle 3.

2. Changes in immune response markers (CD3, NKp46 [and other NCRs], CD25, CD69, and IFN-γ) in peripheral blood from Day 1 (baseline) to Day 21‡  of Cycle 1 and from Day 1 (pre-treatment Cycle 3) to Day 21 of Cycle 3.

MRD will be evaluated in patients receiving Ceplene/IL-2 using RQ-PCR techniques. MRD will be determined at enrollment (baseline) and at the end of Cycles 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10, corresponding to approximately every 3 months during Ceplene/IL-2 treatment. At baseline, RQ-PCR will be performed on genetic (DNA/RNA) material extracted from blood and BM samples. All subsequent evaluations of MRD will be performed using genetic material extracted from peripheral blood samples. Patient blood and BM samples are to be sent to a designated center (specified in the Laboratory Manual) that will process these samples.
E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: During various timepoints in cycles. 
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): Secondary Endpoints:
1. Duration of LFS: LFS will be defined as the time from CR until relapse of AML (defined as 5% or more blast cells in the bone marrow) or death from any cause (whichever comes first) after a follow-up period of up to 2 years.

2. Ceplene/IL-2 safety: Assessments of clinical symptoms, physical examinations, vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests.

3. Potential relationship of Ceplene/IL-2 effects on T and NK cell phenotypes /functionality to MRD: Analyses of changes in T and NK cell phenotypes/ functionality and levels of MRD from baseline to the end of Cycle 3.

E.5.2.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: During various timepoints in cycles.
