E.1.2 Term: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
E.1.2 System Organ Class: 100000004864
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To determine if the addition of monoclonal antibody to standard induction chemotherapy results in improved event free survival in patients with precursor B-cell ALL (aim 1B).
To determine if the addition of nelarabine improves outcome for patients with T cell ALL (aim 1T)

E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To determine the tolerability of pegylated asparaginase in induction treatment of all patients (aim 2) and to compare anti-asparaginase antibody levels between patients in the 2 randomisation groups from aim 1B (patients with B lineage ALL only).
To determine whether risk-adapted introduction of unrelated donor HSCT (myeloablative conditioning in patients ≤40 years old and non-myeloablative conditioning in patients >40 years old) results in greater EFS for patients at highest risk of relapse (aim 3).
To compare 2 schedules of administration (standard vs., ‘collapsed’) of keratinocyte growth factor (palifermin) for efficacy in preventing the severe mucosal toxicity of etoposide/TBI HSCT conditioning regimen (aim 4).
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1 - Subjects must be aged ≥ 25 and ≤ 65 years old with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia OR ≥ 19 and ≤ 65 years old with Philadelphia Chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

5 - Blast transformation of CML
6 - Mature B-cell leukemia i.e. Burkitt’s lymphoma t(8;14)(q24;q32) and variant c-myc translocations e.g.  t(2;8)(p12;q24), t(8;22)(q24;q11)
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): - Event free survival (applies to all interventions)
- Toxicity related to pegylated asparginase (applies to asparaginase evaluation only)


E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): - Anti-asparaginase antibodies (induction randomisation only)
- Overall Survival
- Complete remission rate
- Minimal residual disease quantification after 1st phase of induction (applies to all patients) and MRD quantification post-transplant (applies to the reduced intensity conditioned transplant randomisation only)
- Grade 3/4 graft versus host diseases (applies to transplant patients only)
- Death in complete remission
- Rates of mucositis as reported by Oral Daily Mucositis Score (ODMQ), post-transplant AE data and compliance with delivery of post-transplant methotrexate (applies to palifermin randomisation only)
