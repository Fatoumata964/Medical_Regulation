E.2.1 Main objective of the trial (it): •	Dimostrare che in pazienti anziani cronici, sintomatici BPCO GOLD D con una o più comorbidità cardiaca (scompenso cardiaco, e/o malattia ischemica coronarica, e/o fibrillazione atriale) che sono stati recentemente ospedalizzati a causa di una AECOPD, 1 anno di trattamento con LABD+ICS prolunga il tempo alla prima re-ospedalizzazione e/o la mortalità di qualsiasi causa in confronto con 1 anno di trattamento con solo LABD
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: •	to compare the number of moderate/severe exacerbations of COPD in the two patient groups

•	to compare quality of life (QoL) scores measured using the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and mMRC dyspnoea scale between the two patient groups
•	to verify if one year of treatment with combination therapy including ICS increases the risk of pneumonia
•	to compare the number of acute cardiac events in this frail, elderly COPD population
•	to compare the incidence of deaths due to cardiovascular events
•	to compare changes in lung function

E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial (it): •	Confrontare il numero di esacerbazioni di BPCO moderate/severe nei due gruppi di trattamento

•	Confrontare la Qualità della Vita (QoL) misurata mediante il questionario  CAT e la scala di dispnea mMRC nei due gruppi di trattamento
•	Verificare se 1 anno di trattamento con la terapia di combinazione che include l’uso di ICS aumenta il rischio di polmonite
•	Confrontare il numero di eventi cardiaci acuti nella popolazione anziana, fragile con BPCO
•	Confrontare l’incidenza di morti a causa di eventi cardiovascolari
