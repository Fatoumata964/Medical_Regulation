E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, efficacy study of pramipexole and placebo administered orally over a 12-week treatment phase in Parkinsonâ€™s disease patients with stable motor function and depressive symptoms
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To investigate the efficacy of pramipexole, compared with placebo in treating Parkinsonâ€™s  disease patients with stable motor function and depressive symptoms.  The efficacy of pramipexole vs. placebo will be based on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) total score. 
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To assess further depression response (% patients with 50% reduction from baseline in total BDI score, GDS total score, and UPDRS part I), motor function (standard version UPDRS part II & III), complications of therapy (UPDRS part IV), anhedonia (SHAPS), quality of life (PDQ-39 and EQ-5D), Clinical Global Improvement (CGI-I) and pain (VAS)
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: Information not present in EudraCT

E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1. Previous history of allergic response, lack of efficacy or complications with pramipexole or its excipients.
2. History of suicidal attempts in the last twelve months.
3. Atypical PD syndromes due to drugs,  metabolic disorders, encephalitis or degenerative diseases.
4. History of PD stereotactic brain surgery.
5. History of active epilepsy (i.e. occurrence of a seizure) within the past year.
6. Symptomatic orthostatic hypotension prior to randomization.
7. Malignant melanoma or history of previously treated malignant melanoma.
8. Patients who have received typical neuroleptics, metoclopramide, selegiline or amphetamine derivatives within the past 6 months.
9. Patients who have received dopamine agonists within the past 30 days
10. Electroconvulsive therapy during the 90 days preceding the screening visit (V1).
11. Patients who are currently lactating.
12. Participation in other investigational drug studies or use of other investigational drugs within the previous 30 days prior to randomization.
13. Any other laboratory assay abnormality and/or clinically significant medical/psychiatric condition, which could interfere with patient participation or interpretation of results, or could increase the risk for the patient according to the investigator
