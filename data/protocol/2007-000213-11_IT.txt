E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To compare the efficacy of target Exelon 10 cm2 patch vs. target Exelon 15 cm2 patch in  patients who have demonstrated cognitive decline in the initial Open-label Treatment Phase  (Exelon 10 cm2 patch) with respect to the change from double-blind randomization baseline  to Week 48 of the Double-blind Treatment Phase in cognition as assessed by the total ADASCog  score.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: 1. To compare the efficacy of target Exelon 10 cm2 patch vs. target Exelon 15 cm2 patch in  patients who have demonstrated cognitive decline in the initial Open-label Treatment Phase  (Exelon 10 cm2 patch) with respect to:   the change from double-blind randomization baseline over the 48-Week Double-blind  Treatment Phase in instrumental activities of daily living as assessed by the ADCSADL  instrumental activities subscale;   the time to functional decline (i.e. interval between double-blind randomization  baseline to first decline from double-blind randomization baseline) in instrumental  activities of daily living as assessed by the ADCS-ADL instrumental activities  subscale over the 48-Week Double-blind Treatment Phase;   the change from double-blind randomization baseline to Week 48 of the Double-blind  Treatment Phase in attention and executive function as assessed by the Trail Making  Test Parts A and B;   pls see protocol

The brain  scan (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT)) used for  establishing that these criteria are met must have been done within two years prior to the  baseline visit;  5. an MMSE score of &#8805; 10 and &#8804; 24;  6. sufficient education to have been able to read, write, and communicate effectively during  the premorbid state;  7. cooperative, willing to complete all aspects of the study, and capable of doing so, either  alone or with the aid of a responsible caregiver;  8. residing with someone in the community throughout the study or, if living alone, in  regular contact with the primary caregiver;  9. a primary caregiver willing to accept responsibility for supervising the treatment, (e.g.,  application and removal of the patch daily at approximately the same time of day)  assessing the condition of the patient throughout the study, and for providing input to  efficacy assessments in accordance with all protocol requirements;  10. patients who reside in an assisted living facility may be allowed to participate in the study  provided the patient will be assessed at the study site and that a caregiver who meets the  requirements of the protocol has been identified for the patient.
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: Each patient will not meet any of the following exclusion criteria at the time of the Baseline  Visit (Visit 2):  1. an advanced, severe, progressive, or unstable disease of any type that may interfere with  efficacy and safety assessments or put the patient at special risk;  2. any medical or neurological condition other than AD that could explain the patientÂ’s  dementia (e.g., abnormal thyroid function tests, Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, posttraumatic  conditions, HuntingtonÂ’s disease, ParkinsonÂ’s disease, syphilis);  3. a current diagnosis of probable or possible vascular dementia according to the National  Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Association Internationale pour la  Recherche et lÂ’Enseignement en Neurosciences criteria (NINDS-AIREN);  4. a current DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression, unless successfully treated with a stable  dose of an antidepressant without anticholinergic properties for at least 4 weeks;  5. any other DSM-IV Axis 1 diagnosis that may interfere with the evaluation of the patientÂ’s  response to study medication, including other primary neurodegenerative dementia,  schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder;  6. a current diagnosis of active, uncontrolled seizure disorder;  7. a history within the past year or current diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease (e.g., stroke,  transient ischemic attacks, aneurysms);  8. a current diagnosis of severe or unstable cardiovascular disease (e.g. unstable coronary  artery disease, uncontrolled cardiac arrythmia);  9. a current diagnosis of bradycardia (< 50 bpm), sick-sinus syndrome, or conduction defects  (sino-atrial block, second or third degree atrio-ventricular block);  10. a current diagnosis of acute, severe, or unstable asthmatic conditions [e.g., severe chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)];  11. a current diagnosis of active, uncontrolled peptic ulceration or gastro-intestinal bleeding  within the last 3 months;  12. clinically significant urinary obstruction;  13. history of malignancy of any organ system within the past 5 years unless patient is  verified to be in stable condition with no active metastasis;  14. current diagnosis of an active skin lesion/disorder that would prevent the patient from  using a transdermal patch every day;  15. history of allergy to topical products containing vitamin E;  16. a disability that may prevent the patient from completing all study requirements (e.g.,  blindness, deafness, severe language difficulty);  17. a known exaggerated pharmacological sensitivity or hypersensitivity to drugs similar to  rivastigmine, or to other cholinergic compounds (e.g., pilocarpine, bethanechol, tacrine,  donepezil, velnacrine, metrifonate, galantamine, or physostigmine);  18. taken any of the following substances prior to receiving study treatment:   succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants during the previous 2 weeks;   lithium during the previous 2 weeks;   an investigational drug during the previous 4 weeks;   a drug or treatment known to cause major organ system toxicity during the previous 4  weeks;   any new psychotropic medication or dopaminergic agent or any psychotropic  medication or dopaminergic agent not taken at a stable dose during the previous 4  weeks;   rivastigmine (oral or transdermal patch), donepezil, galantamine, other cholinesterase  inhibitors (e.g., tacrine, physostigmine, or pyridostigmine), other approved treatments  for AlzheimerÂ’s disease during the previous 2 weeks with exception of stable  treatment with memantine for at least 3 months before study entry (Visit 1); pls see protocol
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of target Exelon 10 cm2  patch vs. target Exelon 15 cm2 patch in patients who have demonstrated cognitive decline in the  initial Open-label Treatment Phase (Exelon 10 cm2 patch) with respect to the change from doubleblind  randomization baseline to Week 48 of the Double-blind Treatment Phase in cognition as  assessed by the total ADAS-Cog score.
