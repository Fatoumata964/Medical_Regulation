D.8 Information on Placebo
D.8 Placebo: 1
D.8.1 Is a Placebo used in this Trial? Yes

E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Osteogenesis imperfecta
E.1.1.1 Medical condition in easily understood language: Brittle bone disease
E.1.1.2 Therapeutic area: Body processes [G] - Bones and nerves physological processes [G11]
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 20.0
E.1.2 Level: PT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10031243
E.1.2 Term: Osteogenesis imperfecta
E.1.2 System Organ Class: 10010331 - Congenital, familial and genetic disorders
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To determine if a two year spell of treatment with a drug called teriparatide (TPTD), followed by treatment with zoledronic acid (ZA) reduces the proportion of participants experiencing a broken bone (fracture) which has been confirmed by x-ray or other imaging.  The effects of TPTD/ZA will be compared with standard care which may consist of no active treatment of treatment or treatment with a class of drugs called bisphosphonates depending on the preference of the patient and their normal care provider.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To compare the effects of TPTD/ZA and standard care on the total number of fractures experienced by participants, the number of spine fractures and to determine if treatments differ in their effects on bone pain assessed by the brief pain inventory (BPI); quality of life as assessed by the SF36 questionnaire; sleep quality assessment questionnaire (PQSI); and functional status as assessed by the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and EuroQol5D (EQ5D) assessment tools.

The trial will also evaluate the relationship between patient demographics, clinical features of OI, bone density values at baseline, type of genetic mutation and biochemical markers of bone turnover and fracture occurrence OI and the response to treatment
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: Adult patients age 18 years and above with a clinical diagnosis of OI

Patients willing and able to consent and comply with the study protocol

E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: •	Current or previous treatment with an investigational (non-licensed) drug with effects on bone metabolism.

•	Contraindication to TPTD or ZA 

•	Women of childbearing potential not using highly effective methods of contraception (see below)

•	Pregnancy

•	Women that are breastfeeding

•	Age <18 years

Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) can be enrolled into the study but will be required to use highly effective methods of contraception (as defined by the HMA Clinical Trial Facilitation Group recommendations) before, during the trial if they are being treated with TPTD or bisphosphonates. Examples of highly effective contraception include:
•	Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.
•	Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).
•	Bilateral tubal occlusion
•	Vasectomised partner
True abstinence.  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
Barrier methods of contraception (condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps with or without spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository) are not considered to be highly effective methods of contraception
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The proportion of participants experiencing a clinical fracture validated by x-ray or other imaging
E.5.1.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: This is an event driven study which will be terminated when 149 participants have experienced an incident clinical fracture validated by x-ray or other imaging. This is expected to have occurred after an average of 48 months follow up.      
E.5.2 Secondary end point(s): The total number of clinical fractures experienced by participants validated by x-ray or other imaging.

The number of incident vertebral fractures assessed by imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine. 

The total number of fractures experienced by participants defined as the combination validated clinical fractures and vertebral fractures and fractures reported by participants, where imaging was not performed, not feasible or where the results were inconclusive. 

Bone pain assessed by the brief pain inventory (BPI); quality of life as assessed by the SF36 questionnaire; functional status as assessed by the health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) and EuroQol5D (EQ5D) assessment tools, and adverse events

E.5.2.1 Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: The total number of clinical fractures validated by imaging, incident vertebral fractures, and total number of fractures will be evaluated at the same time as the primary endpoint which on average will be after an average duration of 48 months follow up

Bone pain, health related quality of life and functional status will be evaluated after 12 months, 24 months and at the end of study (approximately 48 months)
