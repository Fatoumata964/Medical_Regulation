E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: P-HIT-REZ 2005 study:
Following the 2nd amendment of this study the recruitment of patients in both chemotherapy-arms (iv: carboplatin/etoposide; oral: temozolomide) and documentation-arm will be ongoing without randomisation.
Due to these changes the primary end point of the study, the progression-free survival after randomisation, can not be evaluated.
Explorative analysis of PFS will be performed as secondary endpoints.

E-HIT-REZ 2005 study (Phase II Study "Oral chemotherapy with temozolomide"): 
Evaluation of response rate (response rate: CR+PR+SD/N) to the 60-days oral chemotherapy with temozolomide (CR complete remission, PR partial remission, SD stable disease, N number of enrolled patients).

Phase II study “Intraventricular therapy with etoposide”:
Evaluation of response rate (response rate: CR+PR+SD/N) to the 5-week intraventricular therapy with etoposide (CR complete remission, PR partial remission, SD stable disease, N number of enrolled patients).

E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: P-HIT-REZ 2005 study: Explorative analysis: Chemotherapy-arms: progressionfree survival (PFS) from start of therapy (PFSTS), OS from start of therapy (OSTS), PFS from response after the 4th chemotherapy course (PFSRESP), OS from response after the 4th chemotherapy course (OSRESP), toxicity rate (CTC), historical comparison with the HIT-REZ 97-Study (PFSRESP, OSRESP), multivariable Cox-regression of prognostic parameters for OS/PFS; Documentation-arm: number, response, toxicity rate of other therapies.

E-HIT-REZ 2005 study: Chemotherapy-arm: PFS from start of chemotherapy (PFSTSCHT), OS from start of chemotherapy (OSTSCHT), PFS from response (PFSRESP), OS from response (OSRESP), toxicity rate (CTC), historical comparison with the HIT-REZ 97-Study (PFSRESP, OSRESP); Documentation-arm: number, response, toxicity rate of other therapies.
