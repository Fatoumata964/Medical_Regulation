MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: To demonstrate that a second dose of Zostavax® elicits higher varicella-zoster virus (VZV) antibody titres than a first dose of Zostavax® whether given as a 0-1 month schedule or a 0-3 month schedule in subjects from 70 years of age as measured at 4 weeks post vaccination.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To summarise the VZV antibody titres at 4 weeks post-vaccination after a 1-dose regimen and 4- weeks post-vaccination after each dose of each 2-doses regimen of Zostavax® administered to subjects ≥ 70 years of age.

To compare the VZV antibody titres at 12 months after completion of a 1-dose regimen with the VZV antibody titres at 12 months after completion of each 2-doses regimen of Zostavax® administered to subjects ≥ 70 years of age. 

To summarise the VZV antibody titres annually at 24 and 36 months after completion of a 1-dose regimen and at 24 and 36 months after completion of each 2-doses regimen of Zostavax® administered to subjects ≥ 70 years of age.

To assess the safety profile of a 1-dose regimen and the safety profile of each 2-doses regimen of Zostavax® administered to subjects ≥ 70 years of age.

9. Immune function inpairment caused by medical condition (congenital immunodeficiency, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, organ or bone marrow transplantation, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, generalised malignancy), or immunosuppressive therapy (examples: chemotherapy agents to treat cancer, treatments associated with organ or bone marrow transplantation, daily - or on alternate days - systemic corticosteroids at a dose ≥5 mg/day prednisone equivalent for at least 14 days in the 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination), or any other cause
10. Receipt of any inactivated vaccine within the 2 weeks prior to the first vaccination
11. Receipt of any other live vaccine within the 4 weeks prior to the first vaccination
12. Receipt of immunoglobulins or blood-derived products within the first 5 months prior to the first vaccination

14. History of alcohol or recreational drug abuse which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with study compliance
15. Any other condition / situation that in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the interpretation of the study, including possible interference caused by acute intercurrent illness (examples: upper respiratory infection, influenza), or any other cause

There are also a list of temporary contra-indications to further vaccination and definite contra-indications to further vaccination. See Study Protocol Section IV.3 and IV.4.
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): Immunogenicity

There are a number of secondary criteria defined for immunogenicity.  See Study Protocol Section XI.1.2 for a listing of these [Evaluation criteria, Secondary criteria].
