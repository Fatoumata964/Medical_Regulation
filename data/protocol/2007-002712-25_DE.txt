E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: Immunogenicity Objectives:

To evaluate the magnitude of antibody responses to one 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose of Aflunov given before or after one 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose of a tetravalent vaccine or after a concomitant administration in different sites of Aflunov and a licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. 

To evaluate cell-mediated immunity (CMI, i.e.: frequency and functional phenotype of Ag-specific T and frequency of Ag-specific B lymphocytes) after one 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) injection of Aflunov or a tetravalent vaccine. Cell-mediated immunity will be performed in a subgroup of 30 subjects.

E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: Safety Objectives:

To evaluate the safety of the administration of one 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose of Aflunov given before or after one 0.5 mL intramuscular (IM) dose of a tetravalent vaccine or after a concomitant administration in different sites of Aflunov and a licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. 
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No

5.	Pregnant or breastfeeding;
6.	Females of childbearing potential who refuse to use an acceptable method of birth control for the duration of the study. Adequate contraception is defined as hormonal (e.g., oral, injection, transdermal patch, implant, cervical ring), barrier (e.g., condom with spermicide or diaphragm with spermicide), intrauterine device (e.g., IUD), or monogamous relationship with vasectomized partner who has been vasectomized for 6 months or more prior to the subject’s study entry;

10.	Hypersensitivity to eggs, chicken protein, chicken feathers, influenza viral protein, neomycin or kanamycin or any other component of the study vaccine;
11.	Receipt of blood, blood products or immunoglobulins 3 months prior to vaccination;
12.	History of any neurological disorder or seizure (e.g., GBS, MS);
13.	Anaphylactic shock following administration of any vaccine; 
14.	Known or suspected impairment/alteration of immune function, for example, resulting from: 
a.	Receipt of immunosuppressive therapy (any systemic corticosteroid therapy or cancer chemotherapy; asthma under inhalative therapy only is permitted), 
b.	Receipt of immunostimulants, 
c.	High risk for developing an immunocompromising disease; 
15.	Receipt of another vaccine within 3 weeks prior to Visit 1 or planned vaccination within 3 weeks following the last study vaccination; 
16.	History of (or current) drug or alcohol abuse that in the investigator’s opinion would interfere with safety of the subject or the evaluation of study objectives; 
17.	Any condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives.

E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The measures of immunogenicity, collected for all evaluable subjects include: 

-	Geometric mean titers/areas (GMTs/GMAs) and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) as determined by HI (and SRH or MN in subsets).
-	Percentage of subjects achieving seroconversion  or significant increase in antibody titer/area  as measured by HI (and SRH). 
-	Percentage of subjects with titers ≥20, titers ≥40, titers ≥80, at least a four-fold rise in titer at days after immunization as determined by MN.
-	Percentage of subjects achieving a titer ≥40/ area ≥25 mm2 after immunization as determined by HI (and SRH)
