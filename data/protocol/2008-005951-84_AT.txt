E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: The medical condition to be investigated is post-transplant hyperglycemia in renal transplant recipients.
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of long-acting insulin (Insulatard®) against post-transplant hyperglycemia, in comparison to conventional treatment, and as evaluated by HbA1c as well as repeated measures of capillary blood glucose levels.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: •	To assess the average post-transplant glucose levels in renal transplant patients under conventional blood-glucose lowering therapy during a period of at least 14 days after transplantation by measuring the capillary blood glucose levels three times daily in both groups of patients (at 8:00, 14:00, 16:00)
•	To assess a full 48h glucose profile in patients treated with long-acting insulin (Insulatard®)
•	To detect the average number of hyperglycemic episodes in post-transplant patients
•	To assess the amount of long-acting insulin (Insulatard®,in units) needed in order to obtain a target capillary blood glucose level in the range of 90 mg/dl to 140 mg/dl before supper
•	To assess the safety of long-acting insulin in controlling post-transplant hyperglycemia
•	To assess the incidence of post-transplant diabetes
•	To assess the morbidity
•	To assess the renal outcome (creatinine levels, rejections)
