D.8 Information on Placebo

E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Subject presenting with acute agitation and/or agression in the context of psychosis, suspected schizophrenia
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: This open-label, single arm, interventional study will collect data on efficacy and safety during first days of treatment with paliperidone ER in patients with acute agitation and/or aggression in the context of psychosis in the psychiatric emergency setting. Primary objective will be the number of patients having an improvement of 40 % or more on PANSS-EC (= response) at day 6 or early termination compared to baseline. 
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: To explore efficacy, tolerability and safety of the use of paliperidone ER in patients presenting with symptoms of agitation and/or aggression in the context of psychosis.
This is done by:
•assessing the change from baseline on the PANSS-EC; 
•assessing the change from baseline on the OAS (Overt Aggression Scale); 
•assessing the change from baseline on disease severity (Global Assessment of functioning [GAF]); 
•differentiate between extreme agitation and extreme sedation (Behavioural Activity Rating Scale , a 7-point categorical evaluation scale
•assessing tolerability and safety by reporting adverse events (AEs) and vital signs. 
•assessing the use of lorazepam.
The most likely psychiatric diagnosis, based on DSM-IV criteria, will be collected at end of trial.


E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
