E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Fabry disease
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 9.1
E.1.2 Level: PT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10016016
E.1.2 Term: Fabry's disease
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The objectives of this study are:
1. To determine whether alpha-GAL activity is present in the breast milk of mothers with Fabry disease who are being treated with Fabrazyme during lactation.
2. To measure breast milk production and composition (volume, protein and fat content) in women with Fabry disease who receive Fabrazyme during lactation.
3. To determine whether Fabrazyme affects the growth, development, and immunologic response of infants born to mothers with Fabry disease who receive Fabrazyme during lactation.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: 
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: Inclusion Criteria - Mothers must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:
1. provide signed written informed consent to participate in this study,
2. be enrolled in the Fabry Registry and receiving Fabrazyme while lactating,
3. agree to adhere to the Fabry Registry recommended schedule of assessments for medical history,  pregnancy outcome, genotyping, and antibody testing, and
4. agree to adhere to the schedule of evaluations for this study.

Inclusion Criteria - Infants must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:
1. have the signed written informed consent of the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) to participate in this study,
2. be born to a mother who is receiving Fabrazyme during lactation,
3. be receiving breast milk from the mother, and
4. have the agreement of the parent(s)/legal guardian(s) to adhere to the schedule of evaluations for this study.
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: The mother and infant will be excluded from this study if the mother has received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to study enrollment.
E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): Mother
• Efficacy:  Efficacy will not be measured in this study.
• Pharmacokinetics:  Blood and breast milk samples will be taken from the mother at Months 1, 3, and 6 for PK testing (if mother is lactating at the time of the evaluation and is receiving Fabrazyme therapy).  Blood samples will be collected prior to each breast milk collection as follows:  sample 1:  immediately prior to Fabrazyme infusion and prior to breast milk collection; sample 2:  just prior to the end of Fabrazyme infusion and prior to breast milk collection; and sample 3:  2 hours after Fabrazyme infusion and prior to breast milk collection.  Breast milk samples will be collected after each plasma collection for PK testing as follows:  sample 1:  immediately prior to Fabrazyme infusion and after plasma collection; sample 2:  immediately after Fabrazyme infusion and after plasma collection; and sample 3:  2 hours after Fabrazyme infusion and after plasma collection.  The volume of breast milk expressed from each timepoint (immediately prior to infusion, from infusion start until end of infusion, and from end of infusion until 2 hours post-infusion) will be recorded and summarized.
• Breast Milk:  Samples of expressed breast milk will be collected by pump at Month 1, 3, and 6 (if mother is lactating at the time of the evaluation and continues to receive Fabrazyme therapy) for PK assessment as above and to test for presence of alpha-GAL activity.  Additionally, the volume, fat content, and protein content of breast milk samples will be determined.    
• Safety:  The IgG antibody titers and incidence of adverse events occurring in mothers enrolled in this study will be summarized. 

Infant
• Efficacy:  Efficacy will not be measured in this study.
• Immunoglobulins:  At birth, a sample of umbilical cord blood will be collected to determine the infant’s Baseline anti- r hGAL IgM and IgG titers.  Testing for presence of IgG and IgM antibodies will also occur at Month 2, 6, and 12.  
• Development:  The infant’s growth and development will be monitored from birth to Month 24 through physical exams and the Denver II Developmental Screening Test.  
• Safety:  The incidence of adverse events occurring in infants enrolled in this study will be summarized.
