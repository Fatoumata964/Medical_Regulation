F.3.3.1 Women of childbearing potential not using contraception  
(For clinical trials recorded in the database before the 10th March 2011 this question read: "Women of childbearing potential" and
did not include the words "not using contraception". An answer of yes could have included women of child bearing potential whether
or not they would be using contraception. The answer should therefore be understood in that context. This trial was recorded in the
