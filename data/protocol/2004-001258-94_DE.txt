3. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥23 kg/m2 and ≤ 40 kg/m2 (See BMI Table Appendix E).

4. Patients must have documentation of a fully dilated ophthalmologic exam 
performed within 1 year of screening in accordance with local guidelines. The documentation must be obtained prior to randomization. This information is of importance e.g., in case proliferative retinopathy is diagnosed while aggressive glucose lowering is considered in the study.

a) Significant cardiovascular dysfunction and/or history including hospitalization within the preceding six months.
b) Poorly-controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg) on two readings (sitting).

   i)   predominant rhythm other than normal sinus
   ii)  A-V block greater than first degree 
   iii) resting heart rate > 100 or < 50 bpm  
The principal investigator, or other designated physician at each site, will be responsible for deciding the clinical significance of any abnormal ECG findings.

10. Kidney disease: 
a) History of renal transplantation or current renal dialysis
b) Clinical nephrotic syndrome, or significant renal dysfunction or disease based on estimated creatinine clearance < 65 mL/min (25), and/or a serum creatinine greater or equal to 1.5 mg/dl (133 µmol/L) in males and greater or equal to 1.4 mg/dl (124 µmol/L) in females and /or BUN >50 mg/dl, whichever is worse.

19. Pregnant or intent to become pregnant OR BREASTFEEDING during study or absence of adequate birth control measures

20. Inpatient surgery anticipated during the study period

21. Known interference with HbA1c determination: hemoglobinopathy or chronic anemia 

22. Investigator or immediate family 

23. Donation of blood or blood products for transfusion during the 30 days prior to initiation of treatment with study drug (if applicable), at any time during the study or 30 days after completion of the study

24. Participation in any other studies involving investigational or marketed products within the two (2) months prior to entry in the study

25. Participation in any prior Inhaled insulin or other inhaled insulin clinical trials, including participation in the “Real World Feasibility Study” (A2170003), excludes patients from entry into this study




E.5 End points
E.5.1 Primary end point(s): The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that mean the reduction in HbA1c after 26 weeks (approx. 6 months) of treatment is greater in patients to whom inhaled insulin is made available compared to patients to whom it is not. Thus, the primary efficacy variable is the difference in HbA1c between baseline (Week -2) and the end of the treatment period at week 52, in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population
