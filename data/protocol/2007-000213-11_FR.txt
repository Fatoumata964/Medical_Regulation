E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female patients between 50 and 85 years of age with a diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer’s type according to the DSM IV criteria in addition to a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) according to the NINCDS/ADRDA criteria.
2. Patients with a baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 10-24 inclusive.

4. Females not of child-bearing potential (surgically sterile or one year postmenopausal).
5. Patients who reside in an assisted living facility may be allowed to participate provided the patient will be assessed at the study site and a caregiver has been identified.

E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1. Presence of an advanced, severe, progressive, or unstable disease of any type that could interfere with efficacy and safety assessments or put the patient at particular risk.
2. Any medical or neurological condition other than AD that could explain the patient’s dementia, a diagnosis of probable or possible vascular dementia.
3. A current DSM-IV diagnosis of unsuccessfully-treated major depression, or any other DSM-IV Axis 1 diagnosis that may interfere with the evaluation of the patient’s response to study medication.

13. History of allergy to topical products containing vitamin E;
14. A disability that may prevent the patient from completing all study requirements (e.g., blindness, deafness, severe language difficulty);
15. A known exaggerated pharmacological sensitivity or hypersensitivity to drugs similar to rivastigmine, or to other cholinergic compounds (e.g., pilocarpine, bethanechol, tacrine, donepezil, velnacrine, metrifonate, galantamine, or physostigmine); 
16. Patients taken any of the following substances prior to receiving study treatment: 
•	succinylcholine-type muscle relaxants during the previous 2 weeks;
•	lithium during the previous 2 weeks;
•	an investigational drug during the previous 4 weeks; 
•	a drug or treatment known to cause major organ system toxicity during the previous  4 weeks;
•	any new psychotropic medication or dopaminergic agent or any psychotropic medication or dopaminergic agent not taken at a stable dose during the previous 4 weeks;
•	rivastigmine (oral or transdermal patch), donepezil, galantamine, other cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., tacrine,  physostigmine, or pyridostigmine), other approved treatments for Alzheimer’s disease during the previous 2 weeks with exception of stable treatment with memantine for at least 3 months before study entry (Visit 1);
