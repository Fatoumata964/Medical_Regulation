D.8 Information on Placebo

E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation
E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: HIV-1 infection
MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: No
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: Antiretroviral regimens containing emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate might be associated with a lower incidence and severity of lipoatrophy. In this study we compare the effect of proactively switching zidovudine and lamivudine to emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate on peripheral fat loss with continued lamivudine and zidovudine-based treatment in HIV-1 infected adults also receiving a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or (boosted) protease inhibitor. In the patients who discontinue the use of zidovudine and switch to emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate we expect to demonstrate a regaining or at least a lack of further loss of peripheral adipose tissue. Primary Objective: to compare the changes in limb fat between the 2 study arms.  
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: - To compare the changes in other aspects of body fat distribution, i.e. fat loss, fat gain, as well as in markers of lipid and glucose metabolism, between the 2 study arms.
- To compare changes between arms in prevalence of lipodystrophy and lipodystrophy severity according to the Lipodystrophy Case Definition Score (LDCD)   
- To compare changes in bone mineral density between the 2 study arms
- To compare the virologic efficacy between the 2 study arms.
- To compare the overall safety between the 2 study arms.

E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: Information not present in EudraCT
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: - HIV-1 infected patients.
- At least 18 years of age.
- Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females.
- Treatment for over two years with a first-line regimen of zidovudine plus lamivudine (as either a fixed dose combination or dosed separately) plus either an NNRTI or a (boosted) PI. Patients may have previously used multiple drugs from both  the NNRTI or the PI classes.
- Plasma HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL for at least 6 months.

E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: - Prior treatment with an NRTI other than zidovudine or lamivudine.
- Use of a triple NRTI antiretroviral regimen or a regimen including unboosted saquinavir, fusion inhibitors or hydroxyurea 
- Prior virological treatment failure, defined as having had to switch to antiretroviral therapy because of virologic failure in the opinion of the physician.
- HIV-2 co-infection.
- Renal impairment and/or use of nephrotoxic agents which in the opinion of the investigator are a contraindication for the use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.
- Clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities: anemia, trombocytopenia, leucopenia, elevated liver transaminases, elevated bilirubin, elevated amylase, elevated lipase. 
- Use of co-medication, other than antiretroviral drugs, with a known pharmacological interaction with one or more of the study drugs
- Active alcohol or drug use, sufficient in the investigator’s opinion to prevent compliance with the dosing schedule and evaluations (methadone and buprenorphine use is allowed, although the dose of methadone might need to be adjusted).
- Anticipated non-compliance with the protocol.
- Presence of a newly (within 30 days prior to the time of  enrolment) diagnosed HIV-related opportunistic infection or condition which may interfere with the ability to comply with the study.
- Chronic active viral hepatitis or other chronic liver disease, which in the opinion of the investigator is a contraindication for the use of any of the study drugs.
- Women who have the intention to become pregnant during the study period.
- Patients who have received within 4 weeks prior to entry, or who have an anticipated need for treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents during the protocol study period.
- Patients who have taken any investigational drug 30 days prior to the start of the study
- Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction which may interfere with drug absorption or prevent the patient from taking oral medication.

E.5 End points

E.8.8 Definition of the end of the trial and justification where it is not the last visit of the last subject undergoing the trial: Trial drugs have been licensed and used for treatment of HIV-1 for several years. No critical AEs, apart from the known side effects of the drugs, are expected. No interim analysis is planned. Trial would be ended if important new data becomes available that may be of influence, or in case the recruitment is unnacceptably low. Ending the trial would have minimal consequences for the particpating patients, since their treatment in this trial does not differ from the regular HIV-1 treatment.
