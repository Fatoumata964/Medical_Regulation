E.1.1 Medical condition(s) being investigated: Refractory Mycosis Fungoides (stage IB-IVB) and Sézary Syndrome.

The study population will be patients who are refractory to or intolerant to at least two prior therapies, one being Targretin, the other being the current standard of care at each institution.
MedDRA Classification
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 8.1
E.1.2 Level: LLT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10028502
E.1.2 Term: Mycosis fungoides refractory
E.1.2 Medical condition or disease under investigation:
E.1.2 Version: 9.1
E.1.2 Level: LLT
E.1.2 Classification code: 10028508
E.1.2 Term: Mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of HuMax-CD4 in patients with MF or SS who are refractory or intolerant to treatment with Targretin® and one other standard therapy.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: Secondary objectives are to explore safety and relief of symptoms and characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of HuMax-CD4 in patients with MF or SS who are refractory or intolerant to treatment with Targretin® and one other standard therapy. 
E.2.3 Trial contains a sub-study: No
E.3 Principal inclusion criteria: 1) A biopsy compatible with the diagnosis of MF or SS with a CD4 positive phenotype within 6 months of study entry
2) MF stage IB to IVB (highest stage ever) or SS
3) Refractory to or intolerant to at least two prior therapies, one being Targretin® (or
combinations hereof), and the other being the current standard therapy at each
institution. Stage 1 patients are only required to be refractory or intolerant to at least one prior current standard therapy

• Refractory is defined as:
- resistance to therapy due to lack of response (defined as failure to obtain at least a 50% reduction in the disease for at least 6 months)
- progression of disease (defined as worsening of the disease by 25% or more compared to pre-treatment status) during therapy or within three months after cessation of therapy

• Intolerance to prior therapy is defined as:
- Discontinuation of therapy due to side effects/toxicity of the therapy. Patients who are intolerant to a therapy and who have had a clinically meaningful response (defined as greater than a 50% reduction in disease) should not be enrolled until disease progression is documented (defined as worsening of the disease by 25% or more compared to the nadir after treatment was discontinued due to intolerance). Side effects/toxicity of Targretin therapy which qualify for the intolerance criteria are isolated hypertriglyceridemia or combined hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia despite concomitant administration of anti-lipemic therapy, defined as:
a) Isolated hypertriglyceridemia defined as Triglycerides > 400 mg/d
b) Combined hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia for non-diabetic patients
Triglycerides > 200 mg/dL plus LDL cholesterol > 160 mg/dL or Triglycerides> 200 mg/dL plus HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dL
c) Combined hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia in diabetic patients (type I and II): Triglycerides > 150 mg/dL plus LDL cholesterol > 130 mg/dL or Triglycerides >
150 mg/dL plus HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dL
Other side effects/toxicities of Targretin, which qualify for the intolerance criteria:
d) ALT > 3 times upper limit of normal
e) AST > 3 times upper limit of normal
f) Bilirubin > 3 times upper limit of normal
g) NCI grade 3 leucopenia
h) Uncorrectable hypothyroidism
i) Drug related dermatitis

• Ineligibility (as part of the intolerance criteria) to treatment with Targretin® despite
administration of anti-lipemic therapy or due to concurrent medical conditions, such as:
- Isolated hypertriglyceridemia or combined hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia, defined as:
a) Isolated hypertriglyceridemia defined as Triglycerides> 400 mg/dL
b) Combined hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia in non-diabetic patients defined as Triglycerides > 200 mg/dL plus LDL cholesterol > 160 mg/dL or
Triglycerides> 200 mg/dL plus HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dL
c) Combined hypertriglyceridemia/hypercholesterolemia in diabetic patients (Type I
and II): Triglycerides > 150 mg/dL plus LDL cholesterol > 130 mg/dL or
Triglycerides > 150 mg/dL plus HDL cholesterol < 40 mg/dL
