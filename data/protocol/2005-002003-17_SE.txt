E. General Information on the Trial
E.1 Medical condition or disease under investigation

MedDRA Classification
E.1.3 Condition being studied is a rare disease: Yes
E.2 Objective of the trial
E.2.1 Main objective of the trial: The main objective with the third Nordic phase II trial in mantle cell lymphoma is to improve the failure-free survival in patients who are not in complete remission before high dose chemotherapy by including Zevalin radioimmunotherapy as part of the high dose regimen before autologous stem cell support.
E.2.2 Secondary objectives of the trial: Evaluate safety and toxicity by including Zevalin in the high dose regimen.
Evaluate failure-free survival in patients in complete remission before transplant. 
Evaluate overall survival, time to treatment failure and and time to progression.
Evaluate response rate and molecular response rate before and after high dose treatment.
Evaluate molceluar response and progression-free survival time in patients  who are PCR+ post transplant( with increasing signal) or convert to PCR+ in the bone marrow during follow up and then recieve 4 weekly doses of rituximab.
Evaluate lymphoma tissue gene expression by microarray analysis as a tool to predict outcome.
